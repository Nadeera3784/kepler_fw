This is currently an empty project/placeholder for where the android phone application should be.

## Idea
The phone app should mainly be a background running service listening to certain events such as text messages, phone calls, etc.
It should also automatically update time information such as time, time zone, and DST. Configuring the app would involve running a BLE scan for locating the watch and also providing a password that will be used for pairing & future communication.
